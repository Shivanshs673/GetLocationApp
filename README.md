## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Requests location permission from the user**: The app will ask for permission to access the device's location when it's first opened.
2. **Fetches the user's current location**: Once permissions are granted, the app fetches the user's current latitude and longitude using the Fused Location Provider.
3. **Displays the coordinates in the app interface**: The fetched coordinates are shown in the app’s UI for the user to view.

The app serves as a solid foundation for further enhancements. Possible future updates include:

- **Google Maps Integration**: Display real-time location on a map.
- **Geofencing**: Set up triggers based on location.
- **Location History**: Log and display previous locations.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance the design for better user experience.
